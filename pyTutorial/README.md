# Python Tutorial
These Python tutorials are intended to provide a crash course
in Python syntax, as well as an overview of some Pythonic concepts.

## Getting Started
To work with Python you will need some sort of IDE, or even just a text editor. I recommend [Atom](https://www.atom.io). It is a great text editor with tons of plugin support, and best of all, it's completely free!

Alternatively, if you are looking for a full fledged IDE, I would recommend (for small projects) WingIDE. It has worked well for me as standalone IDE.

## Which version of Python?
I assume in these tutorials that you are using [Python 3.4](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/). Especially if you are just starting out with Python, there is no reason to use an older version.

## External Resources
This brief, basic overview is dwarfed by the many online resources that you can access to really delve into Python.
- [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/) - From beginner to full programs
- [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) - How to style and format your Python code
- [Python 3.4.3 Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/) - A great resource to start with
