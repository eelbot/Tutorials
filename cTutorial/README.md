# C Tutorial
These short files are made for those who are looking for an incredibly
quick refresher in C, as well as a brief intro to some topics they
may not have seen before.

## Getting Started
When editing C files and executing them, you will need some sort of IDE. I use
Code::Blocks for non-embedded C applications, however Visual Studio is also
a good IDE.
