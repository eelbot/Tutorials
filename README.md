# Tutorials

This repository is meant to hold tutorials and projects
that are used for teaching and workshops. These are not meant
as a replacement for other resources. They are just meant as a
useful tool that I am incredibly familiar with to teach or help
with certain concepts. There is a lot of text in some of these
tutorials, and so if you spot a problem, please point it
out so I can fix it! 


## Python
I originally created the Python tutorial for two reasons. One,
because I really like the language, and two, because it would
be much easier to use than C in a programming challenge, and
I needed something to refer to if I was going to give
tutorials on it. A breakdown is below.
1. Introduction to syntax, math, and while loops
2. Introduction to arrays, strings, and for loops
3. String/Array manipulation, intro to other sequences
4. Intro to functions, input, and output


## C
The C language tutorial is intended as a quick review on
several aspects of syntax. It also provides a brief intro
to pointers.
1. Variables, operations, decisions, loops
2. Arrays, pointers, and strings
3. Input and output

## Arduino
This area is intended for all workshops for the Arduino. Still
a work in progress.
